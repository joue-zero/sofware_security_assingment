# Security Improvement Report: Brute Force Protection

## Executive Summary
This report documents the implementation of brute force protection mechanisms in the Vulnerable Bank application. The changes significantly improve the security of the login system by implementing rate limiting, account lockout, and strong password requirements.

## Before Implementation

### Original System State
- No rate limiting on login attempts
- No account lockout mechanism
- Weak password requirements
- No tracking of failed login attempts
- Passwords were easily guessable (e.g., "password")

### Attack Scenario Before Changes
```python
# Original brute force attack was successful:
[*] Starting brute force attack...
[*] Target URL: http://localhost:8000/login.php
[*] Users to try: ['admin', 'user1', 'user2', 'user3']
[*] Passwords to try: 20
[*] Trying username: admin
[+] Success! Username: admin, Password: password
```

The attack succeeded because:
1. No limit on failed attempts
2. Weak password was easily guessable
3. No account lockout mechanism
4. No tracking of suspicious activity

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Database Changes
```sql
-- Added login_attempts table
CREATE TABLE login_attempts (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
    attempt_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    success BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Added account_lockouts table
CREATE TABLE account_lockouts (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    locked_until TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. Security Parameters
- Maximum failed attempts: 5
- Lockout duration: 15 minutes
- Attempt window: 5 minutes
- Password requirements:
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Must include uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Must include numbers
  - Must include special characters

### 3. New User Credentials
- admin: Admin@123456789
- user1: User1@123456789
- user2: User2@123456789
- user3: User3@123456789

## After Implementation

### Attack Scenario After Changes
```python
[*] Starting brute force attack with new security measures...
[*] Target: http://localhost:8000/login.php
[*] Username: admin
[*] Number of passwords to try: 7

[2025-05-06 15:04:00] Attempting login with admin:wrongpass1
[-] Login failed

[2025-05-06 15:04:01] Attempting login with admin:wrongpass2
[-] Login failed

[2025-05-06 15:04:02] Attempting login with admin:wrongpass3
[-] Login failed

[2025-05-06 15:04:03] Attempting login with admin:wrongpass4
[-] Login failed

[2025-05-06 15:04:04] Attempting login with admin:wrongpass5
[-] Login failed

[2025-05-06 15:04:05] Attempting login with admin:wrongpass6
[-] ACCOUNT LOCKED! Further attempts will be blocked

[2025-05-06 15:04:06] Attempting login with admin:Admin@123456789
[-] Account is still locked as expected!
```

### Security Improvements Demonstrated

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - System tracks failed attempts within 5-minute window
   - After 5 failed attempts, account is locked
   - Prevents rapid password guessing

2. **Account Lockout**
   - Account locked for 15 minutes after 5 failed attempts
   - Lockout persists even with correct password
   - Prevents continued brute force attempts

3. **Strong Password Requirements**
   - New passwords meet security standards
   - Minimum length of 12 characters
   - Requires multiple character types
   - Makes password guessing much harder

4. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - All login attempts are logged
   - IP addresses are tracked
   - Success/failure status is recorded
   - Enables security analysis

## Comparison Table

| Security Aspect | Before | After |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| Password Strength | Weak (e.g., "password") | Strong (e.g., "Admin@123456789") |
| Failed Attempts | Unlimited | Limited to 5 per 5 minutes |
| Account Lockout | None | 15 minutes after 5 failures |
| Password Requirements | None | Strict requirements enforced |
| Login Attempt Logging | None | Comprehensive logging |
| Brute Force Protection | None | Multiple layers of protection |

## Conclusion

The implemented security measures have successfully protected the application against brute force attacks by:
1. Preventing rapid password guessing
2. Locking accounts after suspicious activity
3. Enforcing strong password requirements
4. Providing detailed logging for security monitoring

The system now follows security best practices and provides multiple layers of protection against automated attacks.

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. Implement two-factor authentication
2. Add CAPTCHA for suspicious IP addresses
3. Implement IP-based rate limiting
4. Add email notifications for suspicious activity
5. Create an admin interface for managing locked accounts
