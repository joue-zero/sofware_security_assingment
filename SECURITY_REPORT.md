# ðŸŸ¢ Comparison Table: Vulnerable vs. Fixed Code

| Vulnerability | Vulnerable Code Example | Fixed Code Example | Description of Fix |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **A1: Injection** | `$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'";` | `$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?"); $stmt->bind_param("s", $username);` | Used prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. |
| **A2: Broken Auth** | `password` stored in session and DB as plain text | `password_hash()` in DB, `password_verify()` on login, not stored in session | Passwords are hashed and never stored in session. |
| **A3: Sensitive Data** | `$_SESSION['password'] = $password;` | (Removed) | No sensitive data in session. |
| **A4: XXE/File Upload** | `move_uploaded_file($file_tmp, $upload_dir . $file_name);` | File type/size checks, safe file naming | Only safe file types and names allowed. |
| **A5: Access Control** | No role/session checks on admin pages | `if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id']) || $_SESSION['role'] != 'admin') { ... }` | Enforced session and role checks. |
| **A6: Misconfiguration** | Any file type/size accepted | Only images/PDFs <2MB, safe names | Prevents dangerous uploads. |
| **A7: XSS** | `echo $msg['message'];` | `echo htmlspecialchars($msg['message']);` | Escaped all output to prevent XSS. |
| **A8: Insecure Deserialization** | Directly used POST data in queries | All input validated, prepared statements | No unsafe deserialization or direct use. |
| **A9: Known Vulns** | (N/A) | (N/A) | Use up-to-date PHP/MySQL. |
| **A10: Logging** | No or file-based logging | All actions logged in DB, viewable by admin | Centralized, queryable logging. |

# ðŸŸ¢ Description of Implemented Fixes

- **SQL Injection:** All database queries now use prepared statements.
- **Password Security:** Passwords are hashed using `password_hash()` and checked with `password_verify()`.
- **Session Security:** No sensitive data is stored in session; session checks are enforced everywhere.
- **File Uploads:** Only safe file types and sizes are allowed; files are renamed to prevent path traversal.
- **XSS:** All user-generated output is escaped with `htmlspecialchars()`.
- **CSRF:** All forms include a CSRF token, which is checked on POST.
- **Access Control:** All pages check for the correct session and role before allowing access.
- **Logging:** All key actions (login, logout, transfer, complaint, message) are logged in the database and viewable by admin.
- **General:** No output before headers, session is always started at the top, and all user input is validated.
