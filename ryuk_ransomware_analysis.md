# Ryuk Ransomware Technical Analysis

## 1. Reconnaissance
- **Initial Access**: Ryuk operators typically gained access through:
  - TrickBot or Emotet malware infections
  - Exploiting vulnerable RDP servers
  - Compromised VPN credentials
  - Phishing campaigns targeting enterprise users
  - Exploiting Citrix vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-19781)

## 2. Weaponization
- **Delivery Mechanism**:
  - Initial infection through TrickBot/Emotet droppers
  - Custom PowerShell scripts for payload delivery
  - Encrypted payloads with anti-analysis features
  - DLL injection into legitimate processes
  - Custom packer for payload obfuscation

## 3. Delivery
- **Initial Infection Vectors**:
  ```powershell
  # Example of Ryuk's PowerShell loader
  $encryptedPayload = [Convert]::FromBase64String("BASE64_ENCODED_PAYLOAD");
  $key = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("ENCRYPTION_KEY");
  $aes = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.AesManaged;
  $aes.Key = $key;
  $aes.Mode = [System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode]::CBC;
  $aes.Padding = [System.Security.Cryptography.PaddingMode]::PKCS7;
  $dec = $aes.CreateDecryptor().TransformFinalBlock($encryptedPayload, 0, $encryptedPayload.Length);
  [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($dec);
  ```

## 4. Exploitation
- **Privilege Escalation**:
  - Exploiting Windows Print Spooler (CVE-2021-34527)
  - Abusing Windows Task Scheduler
  - Exploiting Windows Defender exclusions
  - Using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
  - Exploiting Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerabilities

## 5. Installation
- **Persistence Mechanisms**:
  - Registry modifications:
    ```reg
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
    ```
  - Scheduled tasks creation
  - Service installation
  - WMI event subscriptions
  - Startup folder modifications

## 6. Command & Control (C2)
- **Communication Protocol**:
  - Custom encrypted protocol over HTTPS
  - Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for C2 rotation
  - Tor hidden services for command and control
  - Fallback mechanisms using legitimate cloud services
  - Encrypted communication channels

## 7. Actions on Objectives
- **Encryption Mechanism**:
  - Hybrid encryption using:
    - RSA-4096 for file encryption keys
    - AES-256 for file content encryption
    - Custom file extension (.ryuk)
  - Selective file targeting:
    ```c
    // Example of file targeting logic
    const char* excluded_directories[] = {
        "Windows", "Program Files", "Program Files (x86)", "AppData"
    };
    const char* targeted_extensions[] = {
        ".doc", ".docx", ".xls", ".xlsx", ".pdf", ".jpg", ".png",
        ".sql", ".mdb", ".mdf", ".ldf", ".bak", ".dbf", ".db"
    };
    ```

- **Lateral Movement Techniques**:
  - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
  - PsExec deployment
  - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
  - Server Message Block (SMB) exploitation
  - Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
  - Group Policy Objects (GPO) abuse

## Technical Mitigation Strategies

1. **Prevention**:
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Disable unnecessary services (RDP, SMB, etc.)
   - Patch vulnerable services
   - Use multi-factor authentication
   - Implement application whitelisting
   - Regular security assessments

2. **Detection**:
   - Monitor for suspicious file operations
   - Implement EDR solutions
   - Monitor for unusual network traffic
   - Set up SIEM alerts
   - Monitor for suspicious PowerShell activity

3. **Response**:
   - Maintain offline backups
   - Implement incident response plan
   - Regular security assessments
   - Network traffic analysis
   - Endpoint detection and response

## Technical Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

1. **File System**:
   - Creation of ransom note (RyukReadMe.txt)
   - File extension changes to .ryuk
   - Suspicious file operations in system directories
   - Creation of temporary files with random names

2. **Network**:
   - Unusual outbound connections to Tor nodes
   - Suspicious DNS queries
   - Unusual SMB traffic patterns
   - Connections to known Ryuk C2 servers

3. **Registry**:
   - Modified autorun keys
   - Suspicious service installations
   - Modified security policies
   - New scheduled tasks

## Encryption Technical Details

1. **Key Generation**:
   ```c
   // Pseudo-code for key generation
   void generate_keys() {
       RSA_key = generate_rsa_key(4096);
       session_key = generate_random_bytes(32);
       file_key = generate_random_bytes(32);
       public_key = extract_public_key(RSA_key);
   }
   ```

2. **File Encryption Process**:
   ```c
   // Pseudo-code for file encryption
   void encrypt_file(file) {
       file_key = generate_random_bytes(32);
       encrypted_file_key = RSA_encrypt(file_key, public_key);
       encrypted_content = AES_encrypt(file_content, file_key);
       write_encrypted_file(encrypted_content, encrypted_file_key);
   }
   ```
